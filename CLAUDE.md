## Architecture

### Internationalization

- Uses next-intl with server-side configuration
- Supports English ("en") and Arabic ("ar") locales
- Default locale is English (config.ts:1)
- Locale detection via cookies with fallback to DEFAULT_LOCALE
- Translation files in `messages/` directory
- Layout automatically switches between LTR/RTL based on locale (app/layout.tsx:79)

### Project Structure

- `app/` - Next.js App Router pages and layout
- `components/` - Reusable UI components (Hero, Features, Services, etc.)
- `layouts/` - Layout components (NavBar, Footer, LangSwitchButton)
- `messages/` - Translation JSON files for i18n
- `public/` - Static assets including custom Bukra font files
- `types/` - TypeScript type definitions

### Styling

- Tailwind CSS v4 with custom configuration
- Custom color palette: primary (#005394), secondary (#EF6C00), additional variants (primary-light, primary-lightest)
- Custom font family: Bukra (loaded via local fonts with 9 weight variants)
- Custom utilities: max-w-content (1440px), m-nav-bar (94px)
- Responsive design with full RTL/LTR support

### Component Architecture

- Landing page composed of modular sections: Hero, Features, Services, Demos, Pricing, FAQs, Apps
- Components receive locale props for internationalization
- Uses LocaleType from types/LocaleProps.ts for type safety

### Key Configuration

- next-intl plugin configured in next.config.mjs
- Custom font loading with 9 font weights (100-900) in app/layout.tsx:15-64
- Tailwind extends base configuration with project-specific utilities
- Locale detection via cookies ("lang") with server-side configuration in i18n.ts
- Custom margin utility: m-nav-bar (94px) for navbar spacing

### Key Files

- `config.ts` - Global configuration constants (DEFAULT_LOCALE, NUMBER_OF_FAQS)
- `i18n.ts` - next-intl server configuration with cookie-based locale detection
- `types/LocaleProps.ts` - TypeScript interface for locale prop typing
- Static policy pages: privacy-policy, refund-policy, terms-and-conditions
